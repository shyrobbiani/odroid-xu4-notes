Notes related to Go development on ODROID-XU4

This git primarilly provides a repository of notes regarding the use of an ODROID-XU4 as a Go (golang) development server. It contains detailed step-by-step instructions for software installation. If possible, related files are also included.

The goal is to install Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) on a ODROID-XU4 with a basic development environment supporting c/c++, C# for Mono and Go (golang) inclusive LiteIdeX. Part of the full environment is a MySQL server. The modular structure of the notes allows to leave parts not necessarilly needed. The system is designed for 32 GB or more eMMC and optionally requires a 32 GB microSDHC flash card.

Requirements:
- ODROID-XU4 (recommended with cover)
- Monitor with HDMI port for setup
- Ethernet connection to a LAN Router


- A PC with a micoSDHC card reader and an Ethernet connection to the LAN for fast access the ODROID using ssh.
  - PC with Windows 8.1 or higher 
    - Putty (for ssh connection and file transfer)
    - VcXsrv (X server, faster than PuTTYs XLaunch)
    - Win32DiskImager
  - PC with Linux
